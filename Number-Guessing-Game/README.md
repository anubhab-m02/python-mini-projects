# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python script where the computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The user is given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

    ```bash
    python number_guessing_game.py
    ```

2. The game will prompt you to choose the difficulty level:
   - Type 'easy' for 10 turns.
   - Type 'hard' for 5 turns.

3. The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.

4. You will be prompted to make a guess. Enter your guess.

5. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

6. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of turns.
