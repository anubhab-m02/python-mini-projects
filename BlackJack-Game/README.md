# Blackjack Game

## Overview

The Blackjack Game is a simple console-based implementation of the classic casino card game, Blackjack. The player tries to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game features a computer dealer, and the player decides whether to take additional cards or not.

## How to Play

    ```bash
    python blackjack_game.py

2. The game will prompt you to play a round of Blackjack.

3. Follow the instructions to decide whether to get another card ('y') or pass ('n').

4. The game will compare the final scores and declare the winner.

5. If you want to play again, type 'y' when prompted. Otherwise, type 'n' to exit.
