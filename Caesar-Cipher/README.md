# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption and decryption technique that shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It is a substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions forward or backward.

## How to Use

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

2. Choose whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.

3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.

4. Enter the shift number (the number of positions to shift each letter).

5. The script will output the result of the encryption or decryption.

6. You can choose to go again or exit the program.
